# **Word Processor**
#### Video Demo:  <https://share.vidyard.com/watch/hYFrPdmrgwoi2aiQMWNfSw?>
#### Description:
##### This project is what you think it is and what you think it does. It is a word processor that can change text fonts and colors and can do other types of word manipulation. You can save the file to your computer in whatever local directory you would like. It is a project I wanted to do just to see if I could do it.
##### And just to see if anyone actually reads these things, I have decided to put a login page on it. The credentials are username: Grace password: Hopper. Enjoy.
